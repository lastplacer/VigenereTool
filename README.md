The Vigenere Tool program is designed to perform various operations involving the Vigenere cipher. Such operations include message encryption and decryption through the cipher, as well as the operations necessary for the assistance in the cryptanalysis of a message encrypted with the cipher.

In order to run the program, you must have the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed, which can be downloaded from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html. With Java installed, simply run the VigereneTool program. The program includes two tabs of operation, dependent upon the task to perform.

The first tab of the program (Encrypt/Decrypt) allows the user to either encrypt or decrypt a given message using a given keyword. It performs these operations by looping through the message, taking the numeric value of the letter at the current position, and either adding or subtracting the numeric value of the corresponding letter of the keyword, depending on whether encryption or decryption is selected.

The second tab of the program (Cryptanalysis) assists the user is determining the meaning of a message encrypted with the Vigenere cipher. The program first estimates the length of the key using both the Kasiski test and the Friedman test, limiting the possible value to be returned to within the supplied minimum and maximum key lengths. If the user disagrees with the length of the key generated by the Kasiski test, or if they already know the length of the key used, they may manually enter the value into the "Key Length (From Kasiski Test)" field. Once an appropriate value is in the field, the program can then estimate what the key is using a frequency analysis and associating the letter "E" with the most commonly occurring letter within the corresponding division of the message. Once a key is generated, or the user has manually entered a key, they may then decrypt the enciphered message using the key.

Please note that the program removes all non-alphabetic characters from any supplied text before operating on it and does not replace them.
